# Module 2 Challenge: Refactoring VBA Code

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether refactoring VBA code can improve the efficiency of VBA code. In this particular instance, the goal was to reduce the time required to calculate the performance of 12 sample stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. Execution times for the original VBA script (initially created as part of an introduction to VBA coding) and the refactored VBA script were compared.

## Results
Refactoring significantly reduced the execution times to calculate the perfoarmance of 12 sample stocks for both the years 2017 and 2018. For 2017, execution times were reduced from 0.46 seconds to 0.07 seconds (85% reduction). For 2018, execution times were similarly reduced, from 0.045 seconds to 0.07 seconds (84% reduction). For both 2017 and 2018, calculated total daily volume and returns were identical for both the original VBA script and the refactored VBA script.
